= slogcxx = 

Pronouced "Sloggicks".  Why that name?  This is meant to be a Simple
LOGging tool for C++ (cxx).


== Why not use an existing program? ==

Cause they all are too complicated.  log4cxx looked cool, but has many
compiler warnings.  This thing has got to be easy to use.  The other
projects out there:

    * http://log4c.sourceforge.net/
    * http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/ http://freshmeat.net/projects/log4cxx/
    * http://freshmeat.net/projects/log4cpp/
    * http://freshmeat.net/projects/rlog/
    * http://freshmeat.net/projects/logengine/
    * http://freshmeat.net/projects/cxlogging/ 


== Goals ==


    * It has to be dead easy to learn and use.
    * Should be able to write to the console and/or a log file.
    * Would be nice to have a flag to allow xml output, but not essential
    * Should allow usage of <<
    * Should have a more string like interface too.
    * Generate NO warnings (unlike log4cxx!}
    * Only one header file
    * NDEBUG flag to completely remove logging code
    * Numeric and symbolic debug levels. Copy the log4cxx level names. 


== Known Bugs and Issues ==

    * Time formatting is not right.
    * NLOG should only be used the same way across a whole project
