Pronouced "Sloggics".  Why that name?  Google had no hits!

This is meant to be a Simple LOGging tool for C++ (cxx).


== Why not use an existing program? ==

Cause they all suck.  log4cxx looked cool, but we are unwilling to
accept a pile full of compiler warnings.  This thing has got to be
easy to use.  The other projects out there:

    * http://log4c.sourceforge.net/
    * http://logging.apache.org/log4cxx/ http://freshmeat.net/projects/log4cxx/
    * http://freshmeat.net/projects/log4cpp/
    * http://freshmeat.net/projects/rlog/
    * http://freshmeat.net/projects/logengine/
    * http://freshmeat.net/projects/cxlogging/ 

== Goals ==

Kurt offers to give a go at writing a logging class for C++.

    * It has to be dead easy to learn and use.
    * Should be able to write to the console and/or a log file.
    * Would be nice to have a flag to allow xml output, but not essential
    * Should allow usage of <<
    * Should have a more string like interface too.
    * Generate NO warnings (unlike log4cxx!}
    * Only one header file
    * NDEBUG flag to completely remove logging code
    * Numeric and symbolic debug levels. Copy the log4cxx level names. 

What else? I am going to read up on Scott Meyers descriptions about cout and <<.

Brian Calder suggested that maybe http://harvest.sourceforge.net/
and/or some kind of network interface might be a good idea.
